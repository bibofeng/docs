### How to encode Time-Series into Images 
[Articl](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-encode-time-series-into-images-for-financial-forecasting-using-convolutional-neural-networks-5683eb5c53d9)
* How do we visualize timeseries in a meaningful way such that we can train a Deep Learning model with it?
* Using Gramian Angular Fields (GAF) are images representing a timeseries in a non-Cartesian coordinates system (i.e. each point on the plane is referenced by a X and Y axis).
